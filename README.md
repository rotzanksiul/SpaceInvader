# SpaceInvader
This is a space invaders game
This is for me one of the most complicated projects I ever made, I took me a while , but it was worthy.
Javascript was complicated for me when I started to learn it, loops and arrays, but this project helped me alot to better understand
javascript concepts and also help me to feel more confortable with the language.
I love videogames and making this made me very happy, and I added some of my ideas and design to make it look very cool with neon lights.
